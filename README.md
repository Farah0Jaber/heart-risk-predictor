# Heart Risk Predictor – AI-Based Medical Classifier

This project uses real patient data to predict heart attack risk using a machine learning model trained on clinical features. It demonstrates how AI can support early diagnosis in healthcare.

## ⚙️ Features
- Trains a Decision Tree model on real medical data
- Classifies patients as "at risk" or "not at risk"
- Displays predictions, real labels, and model accuracy
- Saves the trained model using `joblib` for future use

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- joblib
